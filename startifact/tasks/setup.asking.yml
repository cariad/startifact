  - title: Startifact project setup
  - text:
      Startifact is designed for projects with multiple build jobs and artifacts
      to wrangle. As such, the "startifact" command line application has no local
      configuration. All configuration is stored in a single Amazon Web Services
      Systems Manager parameter to ensure consistency across the project.
  - text:
      This setup script will create a Systems Manager parameter named
      {param_fmt} in region {region_fmt} in account {account_fmt}.
  - ask:
      question: Is this okay?

      To change the parameter name, set the environment variable
      {default_environ_name_fmt} to the parameter name you want then try again.

bucket_param_name:
  - text:
      Startifact uploads artifacts to an S3 bucket. This bucket must exist
      already, and there must be a Systems Manager parameter holding that
      bucket's name.
  - text:
      This allows you to deploy your artifacts bucket without knowing its name
      (assuming that your deployment records the bucket's name in Systems
      Manager for reference).
  - text:
      If this Systems Manager parameter does not exist yet then abort this setup
      script and create the parameter.
  - ask:
      question:
        What's the name of the Systems Manager parameter that holds
        the artifacts bucket name?
