## Usage

### Staging an artefact

To stage an artefact, pass the project name, version and `--stage` argument with the path to the artefact:

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.9000 --stage dist.tar.gz
```

### Getting the latest version number of a project

To get the version number of the latest artefact staged for a project, pass the project name and `--get` argument for `version`:

```text
startifact SugarWater --get version
```

The version number will be emitted to `stdout`.

### Downloading an artefact

To download an artefact, pass the project name, *optionally* the version number, and the `--download` argument with the path to download to:

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.0 --download dist.tar.gz
```

If the version is omitted or `latest` then the latest artefact will be downloaded, otherwise the literal version will be downloaded.
