Full documentation is online at [cariad.github.io/startifact](https://cariad.github.io/startifact/).

## Installation

```bash
pip install startifact
```

## Configuration

Startifact uses a single shared configuration across all of your CI/CD pipelines.

Full documentation is online at [cariad.github.io/startifact](https://cariad.github.io/startifact/).

## Usage

### Staging an artifact

To stage an artifact, pass the project name, version and `--stage` argument with the path to the artifact:

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.9000 --stage dist.tar.gz
```

Attach metadata by adding any number of `--metadata` arguments:

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.9000 --stage dist.tar.gz --metadata lang=dotnet --metadata hash=9876=
```

Each value must be a `key=value` pair. If the value contains multiple `=` characters then a pair will be made by splitting on the first.

### Getting the latest version number of a project

To get the version number of the latest artifact staged for a project, pass the project name and `--get` argument:

```text
startifact SugarWater --get
```

The version number will be emitted to `stdout`.

### Downloading an artifact

To download an artifact, pass the project name, *optionally* the version number, and the `--download` argument with the path to download to:

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.0 --download dist.tar.gz
```

If the version is omitted then the latest artifact will be downloaded, otherwise the literal version will be downloaded.
