**Startifact** is a command line application and Python package for staging and retrieving versioned artifacts in Amazon Web Services.

- Configuration is held in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Startifact operates consistently across all your CI/CD jobs by default.
- Optional metadata can be attached to artifacts at the point of staging then interrogated later.
- Configuration, artifacts and metadata are stored across as many regions as you care to provide. Startifact is resilient to outages.
